        <p>My hobby is coding with my favourite teacher even if she is the only one. She challenges and quizzes me every single time so I dont forget and find out for myself. Only if she hasn't taught me something and I need help, then and only then she will tell me the answer. The rest she tells me to find out myself as that is what a good teacher does. I think this is a great way of teaching and develops independence in me. I also love coding because of the benefits it gives not only learning how to code but also giving me more focus and creative ideas because of the small mistakes and the various different things to use in a project.

        <p2>My Inspiration is me. I always try to do everything that I can and give my best. I wanted to learn coding before school so I joined White Hat Jr which helped me a lot as I now am a certified Game and App developer.
